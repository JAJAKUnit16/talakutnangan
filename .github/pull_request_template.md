## Rules
1. Under `# Changes`, it is recommended to put a summary of what the PR is all about.
2. Keep your PR's number of edited lines to be low if possible, so they can be reviewed easily. It also recommended having less than 100 commits every PR. The said limit can be ignored for bug fixes, chores, patching security issue.
3. Prefix issue numbers with `lemredd/talakutnangan` to refer to the issues correctly.
4. Put breaking change details below this comment if there are breaking changes. Breaking changes
   could be relocating certain set of files already in master, changing the types that already exist
   in the master branch, new format of response or query, etc...
5. Fixes, breaking change, or initial code of a feature should be merged as soon as possible. This
   is because it can affect the code or experience greatly in the future. Enhancements (such as refactoring) can be
   deferred.
6. If there are lacking mechanism, pull requester should create issues for lacking mechanisms, then just link the issue number.
7. Remove any badge that have no executed test. Replace the `<username>` and `<branch_name>` with
   your username and the branch name of your PR respectively.
8. Add informed discussions if necessary.
